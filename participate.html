      <h2>How do I get my own badge?</h1>
      <p>
        To get a badge for your own projects, <a href="{{ site.inch_pages.project_yaml_url }}">edit this file on GitHub</a> and <strong>add your project</strong> in the form <code>username/repo</code>:
      </p>
      <a href="{{ site.inch_pages.project_yaml_url }}"><div class="edit-file"></div></a>
      <p>
        Then submit the change to create a pull request.
      </p>
      <p>
      I will in turn send you a pull request with your updated README (and a link to your "Inch Page", so you can check it first).
      </p>
      <h2>Why is this not an automated service?</h1>
      <p>
        I would really like this to be one, but unfortunately I'm currently pretty busy (preparing my first teaching assignment). <strong>If this project gains traction, I will work on a web-service</strong> with hooks, oauth et al.
        But until then, this solution can help us to raise awareness for good documentation in our projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        So: <a href="{{ site.inch_pages.project_yaml_url }}">add your project!</a> Pull requests are fun!
      </p>
      <h2>Wait, who are you?</h1>
      <p>
        I'm <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/rrrene">@rrrene</a>, creator of <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/rrrene/sparkr">sparkr</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/rrrene/inch">Inch</a>.
