      <h2>What is Inch Pages?</h1>
      <p>
        This project is an attempt to raise the visiblity of code documentation in Ruby.
        It provides <strong>badges to include in your project's README</strong>, to show people that documenting code is a cool thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The badges are based on Inch and look like this:
        <a href="/participate"><img src="/public/images/badge-example.png"></a>
        <a href="/participate">Get yours!</a>
      </p>

      <h2>What is Inch?</h1>
      <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="http://trivelop.de/inch">Inch</a> is a <strong>documentation measurement tool for Ruby</strong> that was created to help people document their code.
        It is a command-line utility that gives grades based on how complete the docs are (<a target="_blank" href="http://trivelop.de/inch">screenshots</a>).
      </p>

      <h2>What is the goal?</h1>
      <p>
        I really think that posting these badges in a project's README will benefit the project (because <strong>people can see that it's well documented</strong>) and the community by improving the visibility of documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's start a discussion, let's raise the visibility of documentation, let's talk.
